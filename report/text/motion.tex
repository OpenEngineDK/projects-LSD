We can move and stuff!\todoPtx{Generelt om motion}

One of the things we can do using a SDF, is to move the interface by
solving a differential equation.

% Copy this code to grow.tex later?

As written in section \vref{sec:intro:solve}, we can move the
interface in the normal direction using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  \phi_t + a|\nabla\phi| = 0
\end{equation}
