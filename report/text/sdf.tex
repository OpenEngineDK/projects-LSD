\section*{Signed distance function - $\phi$}
In a level set context, the signed distance function is essentially a
measure of, for each point in the domain how far that point is from
the zero isocontour.

Since this function produces the straightforward euclidian distance,
it increases linearly. 

In order to use an implicit representation of the surface we use a
signed distance field as the underlying function to the level set. We
define the zero isocontour of this function to be the surface.

The Level Set method can use implicit functions which means that the
function is defined in the entire plane and not only on the surface.

The function $\phi(x,y)$ is a signed distance function in all of
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$, in our case $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. A signed distance
function $\phi$ is a function that given a point on the plane, returns
the distance to the surface. We have that $\phi(x,y) > 0$ if we are
outside the object and $\phi(x,y) < 0$ when we are inside the object.
And last, when $\phi(x,y) = 0$ we are on the interface or iso-surface.
The iso-surface separates the inside and outside.  Besides indicating
whether we are inside or outside an object, it also indicates how far
we are from the closest point on the iso-surface which is quite
handy. For a picture of the above, see figure
\vref{introduction:fig:implicitfunction}.

$\phi$ is less than zero, larger when we are outside and zero on the
interface.}{introduction:fig:implicitfunction}\todoPtx{Man kunne lave

%% Example - Circle

\subsection*{Example}

A simple example is to consider a circle and its equation:
\begin{equation*} 
  x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}
\end{equation*}

It is defined in all points in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and is an example of
an implicit function. Given a specific radius $r$, the equation of a
circle defines an isocontour. If $r = 5$, then the isovalue is $c =
5^{2} = 25$. For all the points $(x,y)$ that evaluate to 25 gives us
the isosurface. If the value is smaller then it is inside the surface,
and outside when the value is greater. See figure
\vref{introduction:fig:cartesiangrid}.


\section*{Cartesian grid}
\begin{comment} Finite memory -> descritization of plane -> cartesian
grid is used.
\end{comment}

Since a computer has finite memory we need to come up with a way to
store our representation. A simple way to do this is to partition the region into a grid where each
square is of equal size. Normally

\begin{figure}[htb] \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[font=\Large]
    \draw (0,0) rectangle +(2,2)
    +(1,0.5) node {$-1$};    
    \draw (0,2) rectangle +(2,2)
    +(1,1.5) node {$0$};
    \draw (2,0) rectangle +(2,2)
    +(1.5,1) node {$0$};
    \draw (0,-2) rectangle +(2,2)
    +(1,0.5) node {$0$};
    \draw (-2,0) rectangle +(2,2)
    +(0.5,1) node {$0$};
    \draw (2,2) rectangle +(2,2)
    +(1,1.5) node {$\sqrt{2}-1$};
    \draw (2,-2) rectangle +(2,2)
    +(1,0.5) node {$\sqrt{2}-1$};
    \draw (-2,2) rectangle +(2,2)

    \draw[line width=2pt] (1,1) circle (2);
    \fill[shift={(1,1)},red]

    (-2,2) circle (3pt)
    (2,2) circle (3pt)

  \caption{A circle, descritized into a cartesian grid. The value in

In figure \vref{introduction:fig:cartesiangrid}, we see how a plane
has been descritized into a cartesian grid, showing a circle and the
values of $\phi$.

\section*{Solving the Level Set}\label{sec:intro:solve} 

\todoPtx{I own this!!}

If we want to move the level set, we have to iteratively solve a
Partial differential equation to make the surface move. We solve a
partial differential equation in all points $(x,y) | x,y \in
\mathbb{R}^{2}$. If we want to move the interface in the normal
direction we solve the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\phi_{t} + a|\nabla \phi| = 0
\end{equation}\label{eq:normMove}

where $\nabla \phi = \left(\dfrac{\partial \phi}{\partial x},
\dfrac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}\right)$ and $a$ can be of either sign.

When $a > 0$ the interface moves in the normal direction and when $a <
0$ it moves in the opposite direction of the normal.

\section*{Applications}

The advantages are that since we discretize the surface into a
cartesian grid, we can do numerical computations without having to
parameterize the objects. Another advantage is that the level set
method makes it easy to work on geometry that change topology over
time.


%% applications.  So why do we want to use the level set method? A
simple example is to consider an object that splits in two or two
objects merging into one. If we did not use the level set method, we
would have to explicitely represent the two new objects, where in the
level set case we get this for free do to the implicit representation.
