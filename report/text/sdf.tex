I this chapter we will explain some of the more detailed aspects of
the signed distance field we use to represent $\phi$, the signed
distance function. It is in this field we keep, manipulate and work on
our zero-level set. 

We will explain how it is created and maintained, and some of the
different functions we apply to the field to make it morph, grow,
shrink or move.
